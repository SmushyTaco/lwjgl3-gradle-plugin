Registers LWJGL modules on the specified configuration.

The selected modules will:
- Always include [Module.CORE] if it is not already present.
- Respect each module’s [Module.since] version so that modules newer than
  the configured [version] are skipped.
- Add the appropriate native artifacts depending on
  [usePredefinedPlatforms] and [platforms], or the inferred host platform.
